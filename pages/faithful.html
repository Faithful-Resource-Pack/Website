		If you are currently using Kraineff's fraudulent pack, we would like to ask you to stop using it, since that directly supports Kraineff. Additionally, it is recommended to leave his Discord server as soon as possible for the same reason. Faithful is now being run by what was Compliance and Emulated Vattic, now Faithful and Classic Faithful respectively. The only official website where you can find Faithful is <a href="https://faithfulpack.net">this website</a>, with Discord servers being found at the bottom of this page.
