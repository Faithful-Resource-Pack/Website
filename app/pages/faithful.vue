		<h2>
			Faithful was never officially licensed to xMrVizzy, also known as Kraineff, for use or for
			commercial gain.
		</h2>
		<p>
			As such, Vattic has asked him to cease and desist use of the Faithful name, remove it from the
			Minecraft Bedrock Marketplace, and cease development of his version of the pack. Vattic has
			turned over use to the makers of Classic Faithful (Formerly EM) and Compliance (Now Faithful)
			to continue Faithful officially as a community-run project.
		</p>
		<h2>
			If you are currently using Kraineff's fraudulent pack, we would like to ask you to stop using
			it, since that directly supports Kraineff.
		</h2>
		<p>
			Additionally, it is recommended to leave his Discord server as soon as possible for the same
			reason. Faithful is now being run by what was Compliance and Emulated Vattic, now Faithful and
			Classic Faithful respectively. The only official website where you can find Faithful is
			<nuxt-link to="https://faithfulpack.net">this website</nuxt-link>, with Discord servers being
			found at the bottom of this page.
