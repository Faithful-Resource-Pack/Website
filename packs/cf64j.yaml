  The 64x part in the Classic Faithful lineup, Classic Faithful 64x aims to be a spiritual successor to HiTeeN’s 64x pack, as well as many other discontinued 64x projects. Its goal is to bring back the classic “painted” look of Vattic's textures that many players have grown to love over the years, all the while remaking vanilla art in quadruple the resolution.
  <br><br>
  The Jappa version of Classic Faithful 64x is based on the new, updated Minecraft textures that were introduced in release 1.14, as well as the original 32x resource pack by Vattic, brought to life in a high-resolution 64x canvas for double the detail of the original packs.
  <br><br>
  For those of you who prefer a high-resolution rendition of the original Faithful resource pack referencing the overhauled default textures, then this pack is for you!
  <br><br>
  [NOTE: Missing textures will be present, as the pack is not complete. In addition, Bedrock edition is in early development and is likely to be broken!]
