  The 64x part in the Classic Faithful lineup, Classic Faithful 64x aims to be a spiritual successor to HiTeeN’s 64x pack, as well as many other discontinued 64x projects. Its goal is to bring back the classic “painted” look of Vattic's textures that many players have grown to love over the years, all the while remaking vanilla art in quadruple the resolution.
  <br><br>
  Bringing back the nostalgia from the Programmer Art textures featured in earlier versions of the game, this pack brings the original look and feel of the Faithful resource pack and programmer art textures to life in a 64x canvas for a high-definition experience.
	<br><br>
    For those of you who prefer the traditional look of Faithful in a high-resolution canvas, this pack is for you!
  <br><br>
  [NOTE: Missing textures will be present, as the pack is not complete. In addition, Bedrock edition is currently non-existent and will become available at a later date.]
