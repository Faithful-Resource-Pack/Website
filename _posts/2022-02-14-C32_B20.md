long_text: "Another day, another Compliance 32x Beta! The pack is growing exceptionally close to completion, with this update bringing even more lovely textures provided by our equally lovely team. Many minerals have received some much-needed polishing, your trusty steeds have finally tidied up, and the seas are looking alive and well! Thank you once again for your continued support and patience, we look forward to bringing you future updates!<br><br>[NOTE: This version of the pack is compatible with both Java 1.17.1 and 1.18.1. For convenience, we are releasing the update as a single pack. That means you'll get a warning when trying to use the pack in 1.17.1, but you can safely disregard it.]"
