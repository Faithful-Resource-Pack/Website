comments-id: 32x-Texture-Removal

long_text: At Compliance, we care deeply about providing high-quality textures for Minecraft via our resource pack. Because of this, we have built a complicated voting system and strongly curated submission process to ensure that all textures added to Compliance are up to our standards. But none of this was without its flaws, and everything had to undergo a long period of iteration and feedback to reach the state where it is now.<br>Compliance started out as a temporary project, intended to replace Faithful as soon as possible. All textures in the first alpha were compiled with this in mind – some had already been made specifically for Compliance by our contributors, but the vast majority was picked up and retrieved from Faithful's #only-textures channel, from artists that have joined the Compliance team since. These textures were given little to no art direction – not that it was clear what Compliance was supposed to look like back then in the first place. Most of the textures were hastily labelled as "placeholders" (even though nobody knew for sure which exact ones that included) and have lingered in the resource pack since, even after Compliance's art direction was formulated more clearly and after it became clear that it's not going to replace Faithful any time soon.<br>At the time of this announcement being posted, we will have released the rewritten Texture Guidelines for Compliance 32x. They took over a month to complete, span 22 pages and went through large amounts of edits and improvements before being finalised. This is why we have decided to enforce them retroactively, meaning that they apply to ALL textures, not just the ones added after the guidelines were published.<br>That leaves us with a whole bunch of textures that no longer comply with our texture guidelines. To increase awareness and hopefully boost artist productivity, we see it as fit to entirely remove these textures from all future versions of the pack, instead of just having them in some obscure list that nobody knows about.<br>You might say that this change is very radical. And you would be right. But we, as a team, have agreed unanimously that this measure is vital for Compliance's continued existence and quality. Yes, we know this is going to set the pack's progress back a lot, and we really can't do anything about that. But we believe in our contributors and artists, and trust that they will be motivated to fill all the gaps back in again. After all, there's no rush. We'll get there in the end!<br><br>NOTE FOR ARTISTS&#58; A lot of the removed textures are breaking the guidelines just barely, and can be simply be edited so they can be included in Compliance again. We recommend checking if editing is possible first, before starting any work.<br><br>If you are interested in the specific textures that we have decided are no longer fit for Compliance, as well as reasons why they're not, please read below.
