long_text: This is your bi-weekly dose of Compliance, imported organically straight from our Discord and GitHub! This time around we've got a lot of changes to common blocks such as stone, bedrock or terracotta as well as a whole bunch of new mobs like pandas and dolphins! We are also proud to introduce our new, completely unique nether portal texture, which was made with the use of actual minecraft code from older versions. And for Bedrock players we've got a lot of new UI textures! We hope you appreciate the update, and are looking forward to seeing you in two weeks again!
