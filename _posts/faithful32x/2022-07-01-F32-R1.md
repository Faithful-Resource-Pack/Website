long_text: |
  At long last, it is finally time! After roughly a year and a half, we are proud to announce that the first, official release of Faithful 32x on Minecraft: Java Edition is here! With these releases comes one of our largest changelogs ever, along with hundreds of fresh textures for you to enjoy. We hope it will have been worth the wait! You’re definitely in for a treat today, as alongside with the 1.19 pack being fully complete, starting today we’re also going to be officially supporting a whole load of older Java versions; all of them starting from 1.6.4 in fact, plus 1.4.6 and Beta 1.7.3 for the retro players out there.
  <br><br>
  Please note, however, that while the Java pack for 1.16.5–1.19 is fully complete, at the moment of writing there are still some textures to be finished for Bedrock Edition and for Java versions 1.15.2 and below. No matter – we’re putting these packs out as well, it would be a shame to keep them hidden from you! For convenience, these are branded as Pre-releases.
  <br><br>
  Faithful 32x still has quite the journey ahead of it yet. This is, after all, just the first release of the pack and there will always be improvements and additions to be made. From here on out, Faithful 32x will receive monthly release updates. Alongside that, we will be prioritizing Bedrock Edition, beginning Programmer Art, and have much more on the way!
  <br><br>
  The release of Faithful 32x was a long time coming. The project began under the name Compliance on November 5th of 2020 with much work already completed, a great team, and high hopes. Soon after, on December 18th of 2020, contact with Faithful’s original creator, Vattic, was restored. Later, on December 19th of 2021, AntVenom released a video on Faithful that launched our efforts into the spotlight, leading to even greater community growth and efficiency. Finally, on April 4th of 2022, we worked alongside Vattic to rebrand and carry on the legacy of Faithful. Through all this, our community kept making great textures and achieved great success doing so. Today, roughly a year and a half year since beginning the project, Faithful has achieved great success, and it’s all thanks to you.
  <br><br>
  With this great accomplishment in Faithful’s history, we want to thank all of the people who made this possible. Thank you to those who put endless hours of work into Faithful as a whole. Thank you to those who helped spread the word during our breakaway and strived to build the Faithful name back up. Thank you to the creators that offered advice, made videos, and gave Faithful recognition across the Minecraft community. Thank you to the website hosts and teams dedicated to promoting creativity who gave our projects homes. And last, but certainly not least, we want to thank our users for showing us that, even after all this time, your enjoyment never dwindled and made all of this worth it. Thank you for all the support you’ve shown us and Faithful as a whole over the years. You are the ones that inspire us to keep this project alive. Thank you all.
  <br><br>
  This is only the beginning. Have faith, for there will be plenty more to come. :)
