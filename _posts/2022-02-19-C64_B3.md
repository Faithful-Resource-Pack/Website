long_text: With a bit of a delay, the update is finally here with a lot of cool additions and changes. Look at this cute little panda. More blocks are now completed such as: the tall fern, oxidized copper and honey comb block. In addition, we are bringing you villagers, and some of their clothes, as well as spitting llamas and ender chests. This update also includes the redoing of some very old textures from the earlier versions. And as always, take care of yourself and stay tuned for more updates!
