long_text: It’s been a long time coming, but it’s finally here! Beta 17. December is starting up, and the holidays are around the corner. We’ve been working for weeks on this beta, and it has many major changes and additions. We’re glad to announce that the pack has been updated to 1.18 and has the new 1.18 textures.  We’re also introducing changes to iconic textures such as creepers, the grass block, and even Steve. We hope that you like this beta and its many, many changes.<br><br>(NOTE&#58; This version of the pack is compatible with both Java 1.17.1 and 1.18.1. For convenience, we are releasing the update as a single pack. That means you'll get a warning when trying to use the pack in 1.17.1, but you can safely disregard it.)
