			{
				"question": "What is Faithful? How did it come to be?",
				"answer": "Faithful is a project spanning several Minecraft resource packs bearing the same name. The aim of Faithful is to provide a higher-resolution experience while still maintaining the look and feel of the vanilla textures. \nFaithful was originally started by Vattic in 2010, and since then he has given the current Faithful Administration the authority to maintain and update the pack officially.",
				"keywords": ["faithful", "about"]
			},
			{
				"question": "What were the Compliance and Emulated Vattic projects?",
				"answer": "The Faithful project was initially called Compliance, prior to when we had received approval from Vattic to continue Faithful under his brand. In addition, Classic Faithful was an entirely separate project called Emulated Vattic Textures (EM for short), but merged with the Faithful Project and adopted the Classic Faithful name during the Faithful rebrand. \nEssentially, Faithful and Compliance are one and the same, and Classic Faithful and Emulated Vattic are one and the same.",
				"keywords": ["compliance", "emulated vattic", "em", "rebrand"]
			},
			{
				"question": "Who is Kraineff, who is Vattic, and why are there two Faithfuls?",
				"answer": "After Vattic created the original Faithful 32x32 in 2010, he eventually was forced to abandon the project in 2016 due to uncontrollable and unfortunate circumstances in his life. A few months after, an artist named Kraineff (also known as xMrVizzy) claimed that Vattic passed control of the pack to him, and continued Faithful, seemingly officially. \nWhile Kraineff made increasingly questionable decisions and people started questioning his legitimacy, after a breaking point in November 2020 all of his contributors left him behind to start their own project, called Compliance. Around a month later, these contributors gained contact with Vattic, confirming their suspicions that Vattic never authorized Kraineff to continue Faithful, essentially meaning that Kraineff had been profiting off a stolen name for over 4 years and had been lying about ownership the whole time. If you're interested in this part of the story, you should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgZYBTlwaVs) for more information. \nHowever, afterwards when it was clear that Kraineff was never going to willingly relinquish the Faithful name to the now-official Compliance project, the Compliance project rebranded to Faithful in April 2022, causing there to be two Faithfuls.",

Examples: 3D items, Consistent Bedrock. \n**Add-on**: An Add-on adds new features to the game, and/or is usually larger in scope than a Tweak. Examples: New random variations for blocks/mobs. \nAdditionally, due to technical limitations, PBR resource packs cannot reuse textures from the main Faithful pack, and therefore can function as standalone – but for the sake of simplicity, they are also considered Add-ons. \nLastly, collections of Tweaks that the author chooses not to submit individually are considered Add-ons as well.",
